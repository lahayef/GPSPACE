The source files in this directory were downloaded from the IGRF web site:
        https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/international-geomagnetic-reference-field

Original directory contains the original igrf14.f program and the current
(IGRF) directory contains a modification of that file, converting it to a
subroutine usable in GPSPACE.

Subroutine igrf14syn is called from iono2nd.f to compute 2nd and 3rd order
ionospheric effects.
